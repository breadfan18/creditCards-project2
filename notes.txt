Challenges: 
- When submitting new card, Could not find user _id since it was not part of req.params
- Solved this by the following code in cards controller
- Used Model.findOne() to find the user by querying the firstName and lastName 

function create(req, res) {
    let nameSplitArr = req.body.applicant.split(' ');
    User.findOne({
        firstName: nameSplitArr[0],
        lastName: nameSplitArr[1]
    }, function (err, user) {
        let newCardObj = {
            applicant: user._id,
            issuer: req.body.issuer,
            cardName: req.body.cardName,
            appDate: req.body.appDate,
            creditPull: [req.body.experian, req.body.equifax, req.body.transunion],
            nextFeeDate: req.body.nextFeeDate,
            creditLine: req.body.creditLine,
            bonusSpend: req.body.bonusSpend,
            bonusSpendDate: req.body.bonusSpendDate,
            annualFee: req.body.annualFee
        }
        Card.create(newCardObj, function(err, card){
            if(err) return res.redirect('/cards/new');
            res.redirect('/cards');
        })
    })
}


- When trying to submit the changes to card, i wanted the first button to edit card, and the second to submit
- Found out when submitting an HTML5 form, button has a type of submit by default, so if you don't waht
- the button to submit, you have to explicitly change its type to..lets say button
    <button type="button" id="editCardButton">Edit Card</button>
    <button type="submit" value="Submit" id="updateButton">Submit</button>


- Adding card data was a challenge, and was taking too long. 
- Solution, created a script using webdriverIO that will run through the addCard flow in abt 5 secs.



- BUG: Users with active cards were showing delete button active. This caused problems if we deleted users that had active cards. Implemented code below to disable
- But some were getting disabled, others were not
<td>
    <form action="/users/<%= user._id %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
        <button id="delUserButton" type="submit" class="btn btn-sm btn-danger"
            <% cards.forEach(card => { %><%= user._id.equals(card.applicant) ? 'disabled ' : null %><% }); %>>Delete</button>
    </form>
</td>
- Reason for the bug, users with multiple cards were getting disableddisableddisabled etc added 
- I added a single space character after disabled, and that fixed the problem
